# SchwartzSmith.jl
SchwartzSmith.jl is a package for estimating the Schwartz Smith model.\
The implementation and notation was based on the original article by Eduardo Schwartz and James E. Smith (2000), called "Short-Term Variations and Long-Term Dynamics in Commodity Prices".

##Features

* Parameter estimation
1. Original and average time to maturity

2. Random or predefined seed

* Simulation

* Forecasting


<!-- The Schwartz-Smith model equations are:\
Observation equation: **$y_t = d_t + F'_tx_t + v_t$**\
State equations: **$x_t = c + Gx_{t-1} + Ï‰_t$** -->
